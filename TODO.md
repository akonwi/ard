## TODO

- [ ] networking
- [ ] methods on enums?
- [ ] matching on numbers
- [ ] two part cursor in loops
  - `for person,index in employees { io.print(index) }`
- [ ] calling functions with named arguments
- [ ] Errors and handling
  - Decide whether to use an Error type or Result like Rust
  - try syntax with a block/expression to provide fallback: `let number: Int = try dangerous_op() else 0 `
  - try? syntax to create a maybe: `let maybe_num: Int = try? dangerous_op()`
  - try! to return error: `let num = try! dangerous()`
- [ ] eloquent relative conditions
  - `200 <= status <= 300`
- [ ] ?: make less scripty
  - [ ] introduce `main()` function for execution start
  - [ ] allow non-linear declarations at the top level
    -  i.e. a type declared at the top of the file, can reference one declared below
- [ ] matching on strings?
- [ ] traits
  - String - use for printables and interpolatables
- [ ] packages
  - follow Go; folder is package
  - ?: use reflection to call into packages?
- [ ] loops as expressions (comprehensions?)
  - `let doubled: [Int] = for i in 1..10 { i * 2 }`
- [ ] concurrency (Task?)
