## TODO

- [ ] `try?` syntax to turn a Result into a Maybe: `let maybe_num: Int = try? dangerous_op()`
- [ ] `try!` syntax to unwrap value or immediately return error Result: `let num = try! dangerous()`
- [ ] syntax for generics on structs
  - `struct Box { item: $T }`
- [ ] methods on enums?
- [ ] matching on numbers
- [ ] `?` sugar for propagating maybes
  - `res?.json()` -> `match res { r => r.json(), _ => maybe::non() }`
- [ ] simplify while loop syntax to `for`, like go
- [ ] two part cursor in loops
  - `for person,index in employees { io.print(index) }`
- [ ] calling functions with named arguments
- [ ] eloquent relative conditions
  - `200 <= status <= 300`
- [ ] ?: make less scripty
  - [ ] `main()` function for execution start
  - [ ] allow non-linear declarations at the top level
    -  i.e. a type declared at the top of the file, can reference one declared below
- [ ] matching on strings?
- [ ] traits
  - String - use for printables and interpolatables
- [ ] packages
  - follow Go; folder is package
  - ?: use reflection to call into packages?
- [ ] loops as expressions (comprehensions?)
  - `let doubled: [Int] = for i in 1..10 { i * 2 }`
- [ ] concurrency (Task?)
